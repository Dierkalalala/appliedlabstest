                    Again FasterÂ® Rubber Hex Dumbbells offer one of the most effective ways to add variance to any
                    training program. Functional dumbbell movements cultivate stability, coordination and strength in
                    ways that cannot be achieved using a barbell. Lighter dumbbells are great tools for accommodating
                    athletes with an injury or those not yet comfortable with a bar. Whether you are making your first
                    equipment purchase or looking to expand your gym's capabilities, making dumbbells a priority will
                    take your training to the next level.
